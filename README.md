#### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare data

#### Description
In this project, _Python_ is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—_Chicago, New York City, and Washington_. Code is written to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. A script is written that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

#### Software required
To complete this project, the following software requirements apply:

    -   Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
    -   A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
    -   A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows)

#### Data used

**Files**

The following file includes the Python script:

*   *bikeshare.py*

Three further data files are provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider in the United States:

*   *chicago.csv*
*   *new_york_city.csv*
*   *washington.csv*

**Datasets**

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

    -   Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
    -   End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
    -   Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
    -   Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
    -   End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
    -   User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:

    -   Gender
    -   Birth Year
